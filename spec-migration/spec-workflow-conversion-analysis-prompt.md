# Spec Workflow Conversion Analysis and Migration Plan

## Context

You are tasked with analyzing the existing documentation structure of the Pocket Agent project and creating a comprehensive migration plan to convert it to the spec workflow methodology. The project currently uses a custom documentation structure that needs to be reorganized according to the spec workflow phases.

## Current Project Overview

The Pocket Agent project is a mobile interface for controlling Claude Code remotely. It consists of:
- An Android mobile application (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose)
- A wrapper service (Node.js/TypeScript) that interfaces with Claude Code
- WebSocket communication between mobile app and server
- SSH key authentication and secure communication protocols

## Your Task

Perform a thorough analysis of the existing documentation and create a detailed migration plan following these phases:

### Phase 1: Documentation Analysis

1. **Review Existing Documentation Structure**
   - Main documentation directory: `/documentation/`
   - Key files to analyze:
     - `project.spec.md` - Overall system specification
     - `claude-code-sdk-messages.spec.md` - SDK integration details
     - `mobile-app-spec/` directory containing all mobile app documentation
     - Various `*.feat.md` files describing individual features
     - `*.info.md` files with reference information
     - Template files in `templates/` directory

2. **Identify Documentation Categories**
   - Technical specifications (*.spec.md)
   - Feature documentation (*.feat.md)
   - Information/reference files (*.info.md)
   - Index files (CLAUDE.md)
   - Templates and examples

3. **Map Current Content to Spec Workflow Phases**
   For each document, determine which spec workflow phase it belongs to:
   - Architecture documentation
   - Requirements documentation
   - Design documentation
   - Task breakdowns
   - Implementation details

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis

1. **Identify Missing Components**
   - Which spec workflow documents are missing entirely?
   - Which existing documents are incomplete or need enhancement?
   - What new documentation needs to be created?

2. **Content Quality Assessment**
   - Are requirements properly formatted with user stories and acceptance criteria?
   - Do design documents include architecture diagrams?
   - Are tasks properly broken down with requirement references?
   - Is there a global architecture.md file?

### Phase 3: Migration Strategy

1. **Create Migration Plan**
   - Prioritize which features/components to migrate first
   - Determine if any features need to be split or combined
   - Plan the new directory structure under `documentation/`

2. **Content Transformation Guidelines**
   For each existing document type, specify how to transform it:
   
   **For existing *.spec.md files:**
   - Extract architectural information → architecture.md
   - Extract requirements → features/{name}/requirements.md
   - Extract design details → features/{name}/design.md
   - Extract implementation details → features/{name}/tasks.md

   **For existing *.feat.md files:**
   - Create feature directory under documentation/features/
   - Split content into appropriate spec workflow documents
   - Ensure proper formatting for each phase

   **For split feature documentation (with *-index.md files):**
   - Consolidate related files into unified spec workflow structure
   - Maintain logical organization while following spec format

### Phase 4: Implementation Roadmap

Create a step-by-step roadmap with the following structure:

```markdown
## Spec Workflow Migration Roadmap

### Step 1: Create Global Architecture Document
- [ ] Analyze project.spec.md for architectural information
- [ ] Extract technology stack details
- [ ] Document overall system architecture
- [ ] Create documentation/architecture.md

### Step 2: Migrate Core Features
For each major feature (in priority order):

#### Feature: [Feature Name]
- [ ] Create documentation/features/{feature-name}/ directory
- [ ] Extract/create research.md from existing documentation
- [ ] Transform content into requirements.md with proper user stories
- [ ] Create/enhance design.md with architecture diagrams
- [ ] Break down implementation into tasks.md
- [ ] Create context.md for feature background

### Step 3: Create Missing Documentation
- [ ] Identify features without documentation
- [ ] Run spec workflow for undocumented features
- [ ] Ensure all features have complete spec documentation

### Step 4: Update References and Navigation
- [ ] Update all CLAUDE.md index files
- [ ] Create new navigation structure
- [ ] Update cross-references between documents
- [ ] Verify all links work correctly

### Step 5: Validation
- [ ] Verify each feature has all required spec documents
- [ ] Check that all code references are accurate
- [ ] Ensure requirements have proper acceptance criteria
- [ ] Validate task breakdowns reference requirements
```

### Phase 5: Quality Checklist

Create a comprehensive checklist to ensure migration quality:

```markdown
## Migration Quality Checklist

### For Each Feature:
- [ ] Has dedicated directory under documentation/features/
- [ ] Contains context.md with feature background
- [ ] Contains research.md with codebase analysis
- [ ] Contains requirements.md with:
  - [ ] User stories in proper format
  - [ ] EARS-formatted acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Contains design.md with:
  - [ ] Architecture overview
  - [ ] Component specifications
  - [ ] Mermaid diagrams where applicable
  - [ ] Error handling strategy
- [ ] Contains tasks.md with:
  - [ ] Atomic, executable tasks
  - [ ] Requirement references (_Requirements: X.Y_)
  - [ ] Logical task ordering
  - [ ] Clear implementation steps

### Global Documentation:
- [ ] architecture.md exists and is comprehensive
- [ ] All features listed in main index
- [ ] Navigation is clear and intuitive
- [ ] No orphaned documentation files
```

## Deliverables

After completing your analysis, provide:

1. **Current State Analysis Document**
   - Summary of existing documentation structure
   - List of all documentation files with their purpose
   - Assessment of documentation completeness

2. **Migration Plan Document**
   - Detailed mapping of current docs to spec workflow structure
   - Priority order for migration
   - Estimated effort for each component

3. **Conversion Instructions**
   - Step-by-step guide for converting each document type
   - Templates for missing documentation
   - Examples of properly converted documents

4. **Validation Criteria**
   - How to verify successful migration
   - Quality standards for each document type
   - Testing checklist for converted documentation

## Important Considerations

1. **Preserve Valuable Content**: Don't lose any important technical details during migration
2. **Maintain Consistency**: Use the spec workflow structure consistently across all features
3. **Consider Dependencies**: Some features may depend on others - maintain these relationships
4. **Mobile-First Focus**: Remember this is an Android application - maintain platform-specific details
5. **Implementation Ready**: Ensure all documentation remains actionable for developers

## Example Migration

Here's an example of how to migrate the "Communication Layer" feature:

**Current Structure:**
```
mobile-app-spec/communication-layer/
├── communication-layer-index.md
├── communication-layer-overview.feat.md
├── communication-layer-websocket.feat.md
├── communication-layer-authentication.feat.md
├── communication-layer-messages.feat.md
└── communication-layer-testing.feat.md
```

**Target Structure:**
```
documentation/features/communication-layer/
├── context.md (extracted from overview)
├── research.md (new - analyze existing WebSocket implementation)
├── requirements.md (transform from feat files into user stories)
├── design.md (consolidate technical details with diagrams)
└── tasks.md (create implementation task breakdown)
```

## Begin Your Analysis

Start by reading through all documentation files in the following order:
1. `/documentation/project.spec.md`
2. `/documentation/CLAUDE.md`
3. `/documentation/mobile-app-spec/CLAUDE.md`
4. All `*.feat.md` files
5. All `*.spec.md` files
6. Template files

Then create your comprehensive migration plan following the phases outlined above.
