- Clear naming conventions followed

## Global Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Purpose Statements in Code Blocks
**Severity**: Minor  
**Affected Features**: Communication Layer, Background Services, Security Authentication  
**Recommendation**: Add Purpose comments to all code blocks in tasks.md files

### 2. Inconsistent Requirement References
**Severity**: Minor  
**Affected Features**: All features have some tasks without references  
**Recommendation**: Ensure every task has _Requirements: X.Y_ reference

### 3. Format Variations
**Severity**: Minor  
**Affected Features**: Screen Design uses different task format  
**Recommendation**: Standardize task format across all features

### 4. Cross-Feature Dependencies
**Severity**: Major  
**Issue**: Dependencies between features not always clearly specified  
**Recommendation**: Create dependency matrix showing inter-feature requirements

## Validation Checklist Summary
