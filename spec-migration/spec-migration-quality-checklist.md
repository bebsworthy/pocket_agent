## Common Quality Issues

### Red Flags to Watch For

1. **Requirements Issues**
   - ❌ "System shall be fast" (not measurable)
   - ✅ "System shall respond within 2 seconds"
   
2. **Design Issues**
   - ❌ Pseudo-code or incomplete examples
   - ✅ Complete, runnable code examples
   
3. **Task Issues**
   - ❌ "Implement the feature" (too broad)
   - ✅ "Create WebSocketClient.kt with connect() method"
   
4. **Context Issues**
   - ❌ Technical implementation details
   - ✅ User needs and business value

## Continuous Improvement

### Post-Migration Review
- [ ] Collect team feedback
- [ ] Identify improvement areas
- [ ] Update templates based on learning
- [ ] Refine quality criteria
- [ ] Document best practices discovered

### Maintenance Quality
- [ ] Establish update procedures
- [ ] Define review cycles
- [ ] Assign documentation owners
- [ ] Create change tracking process

## Conclusion

This quality checklist ensures that migrated documentation meets the highest standards of the spec workflow methodology. By following this checklist:

1. **Consistency** - All features follow the same high standard
2. **Completeness** - No critical information is missed
3. **Usability** - Developers can successfully implement features
4. **Maintainability** - Documentation remains valuable over time

Remember: Quality documentation is an investment in the project's future success. Take the time to check every item - your future self and team will thank you!
