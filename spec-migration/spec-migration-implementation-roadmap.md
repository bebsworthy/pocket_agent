## Date: 2024-01-26

### What Worked Well
- Systematic 5-document structure provided clear organization
- User story format with EARS acceptance criteria improved clarity
- Breaking large features into phases helped manage complexity
- Research documentation uncovered valuable technical insights
- Task breakdowns provided realistic implementation planning

### What Was Challenging
- Consolidating multiple source files (6-9 files) into 5 documents
- Maintaining technical accuracy while rewriting for different audiences
- Creating comprehensive research sections from existing content
- Estimating realistic task durations without team input

### Improvement for Next Time
- Create automated link validation scripts upfront
- Build content mapping templates for multi-file features
- Develop user story generators for common patterns
- Include code validation in the migration process

### Pattern Discovered
- Features with 6+ source files benefit from sub-feature consideration
- Business context should always precede technical details
- Research sections reveal gaps in original documentation
- Task estimates typically range 3-15 weeks per feature
```

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to migrating Pocket Agent documentation to the spec workflow format. By following this checklist:

1. **No content will be lost** - Every step includes validation
2. **Quality will improve** - Adding structure and user focus
3. **Team will be prepared** - Training is built into the process
4. **Future features benefit** - Templates and patterns established

The key to success is methodical execution, regular validation, and team communication throughout the 21-day migration period.
