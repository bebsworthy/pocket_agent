# Pocket Agent Documentation Migration - Execution Guide

## How to Execute the Pocket Agent Documentation Migration Plan

### Overview

This guide explains how to execute the comprehensive migration plan to convert Pocket Agent's documentation from its current custom structure to the spec workflow methodology. The migration involves transforming 37 existing files into approximately 67 spec-compliant files across 5 phases.

### Migration Resources

You have 5 key documents to guide the migration:

1. **`spec-migration-current-state-analysis.md`** - Shows what currently exists
2. **`spec-migration-strategy.md`** - Explains the transformation approach  
3. **`spec-migration-conversion-instructions.md`** - Provides step-by-step conversion guides
4. **`spec-migration-implementation-roadmap.md`** - Contains the detailed execution checklist
5. **`spec-migration-quality-checklist.md`** - Defines quality validation criteria

### Execution Strategy

#### Phase-by-Phase Approach

Follow the 5-phase plan outlined in the Implementation Roadmap:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Architecture + Data Layer)
- **Phase 2**: Core Infrastructure (Communication + Background Services)
- **Phase 3**: Application Layer (Security + UI Navigation)
- **Phase 4**: Completion (Screen Design + Templates)
- **Phase 5**: Validation and Launch

#### Using Sub-Agents for Parallel Work

When working on independent features, use the general-purpose agent to handle multiple migrations in parallel:

```
For Phase 2, you can migrate Communication Layer and Background Services simultaneously:

Task 1: "Read the spec-migration-implementation-roadmap.md Phase 2 section, then migrate the Communication Layer feature following the checklist for Step 3"

Task 2: "Read the spec-migration-implementation-roadmap.md Phase 2 section, then migrate the Background Services feature following the checklist for Step 4"
```

### Execution Commands

#### Starting the Migration

```
"Please begin the Pocket Agent documentation migration to spec workflow. Start by reading all 5 migration plan documents (spec-migration-*.md files), then begin with Phase 1: creating the global architecture.md file following the Implementation Roadmap checklist."
```

#### For Each Feature Migration

```
"Migrate the [feature-name] feature to spec workflow format. Follow these steps:
1. Read the relevant section in spec-migration-implementation-roadmap.md
2. Use spec-migration-conversion-instructions.md for transformation rules
3. Create the 5 required documents (context.md, research.md, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
4. Validate using spec-migration-quality-checklist.md
5. Preserve all technical content from the original files"
```

#### Using Sub-Agents for Research

When creating research.md files, use the general-purpose agent:

```
"Analyze the Pocket Agent codebase to create research.md for the [feature-name] feature. Search for:
1. Similar patterns in the Android app code
2. Existing implementations to reuse
3. Technology decisions already made
4. Integration points with other features
Follow the research.md template in spec-migration-conversion-instructions.md"
```

### Monitoring Progress

#### Daily Progress Check

```
"Show me the migration progress:
1. Check which phases are complete in the Implementation Roadmap
2. List which features have been migrated
3. Identify any blockers or issues
4. Show the next tasks to complete"
```

#### Quality Verification

After each feature migration:

```
"Validate the [feature-name] migration using spec-migration-quality-checklist.md:
1. Verify all 5 documents are present
2. Check that requirements are in EARS format
3. Ensure all tasks reference requirements
4. Confirm no content was lost from original files
5. Run through the complete quality checklist"
```

### Critical Guidelines

#### Information Preservation

**MANDATORY**: Before transforming any file:
1. Read the entire original file
2. Create a content inventory
3. Ensure every technical detail is mapped to a new location
4. Verify file sizes are approximately equivalent after migration

#### Parallel Work Safety

Safe for parallel execution:
- Different features can be migrated simultaneously
- Creating research.md while another agent creates requirements.md
- Updating templates while features are being migrated

NOT safe for parallel execution:
- Multiple agents working on the same feature
- Creating architecture.md (must be done first, alone)
- Final validation phase

### Validation Process

#### Per-Feature Validation

```
"Validate the [feature-name] migration:
1. Run through spec-migration-quality-checklist.md section by section
2. Verify cross-document references work
3. Ensure all code examples compile
4. Check requirement traceability
5. Confirm with: 'Feature [name] passes all quality checks'"
```

#### Global Validation

```
"Perform final migration validation:
1. Check all 7 features have complete documentation
2. Verify architecture.md is comprehensive
3. Test all cross-references and links
4. Ensure templates are updated
5. Confirm old docs are properly archived"
```

### Example: Migrating Communication Layer

Here's a complete example for one feature:

```
"Migrate the Communication Layer feature following the implementation roadmap Phase 2, Step 3. 

First, read:
1. The Step 3 checklist in spec-migration-implementation-roadmap.md
2. The Communication Layer example in spec-migration-conversion-instructions.md
3. All 6 original files in documentation/mobile-app-spec/communication-layer/

Then:
1. Create documentation/features/communication-layer/ directory
2. Transform the content following the mapping table:
   - overview.feat.md → context.md + design.md
   - websocket.feat.md → requirements.md + design.md
   - authentication.feat.md → requirements.md + design.md
   - messages.feat.md → design.md
   - testing.feat.md → design.md + tasks.md
3. Create research.md by analyzing WebSocket patterns in the codebase
4. Generate tasks.md from the design components
5. Validate using the quality checklist
6. Mark the checklist items complete in the roadmap"
```

### Success Criteria

The migration is complete when:
1. All checkboxes in `spec-migration-implementation-roadmap.md` are checked
2. All features pass the quality checklist
3. No content has been lost (verified by size comparison)
4. Team training is complete
5. Old documentation is archived

### Tips for Agents

1. **Always read before writing** - Understand the full context before creating new documents
2. **Use templates** - The conversion instructions provide templates for each document type
3. **Preserve everything** - When in doubt, include content rather than omit it
4. **Follow the checklist** - The implementation roadmap has detailed steps for each phase
5. **Validate frequently** - Check quality after each document, not just at the end

### Quick Reference Commands

#### Phase 1 - Foundation
```
"Execute Phase 1 of the spec migration:
1. Create architecture.md following spec-migration-implementation-roadmap.md Step 1
2. Migrate Data Layer feature following Step 2
3. Complete Phase 1 checkpoint validation"
```

#### Phase 2 - Core Infrastructure
```
"Execute Phase 2 of the spec migration:
1. Migrate Communication Layer (Step 3) and Background Services (Step 4) in parallel
2. Use sub-agents for research.md creation
3. Complete Phase 2 checkpoint validation"
```

#### Phase 3 - Application Layer
```
"Execute Phase 3 of the spec migration:
1. Migrate Security Authentication (Step 5)
2. Migrate UI Navigation Foundation (Step 6) - note this has 9 source files
3. Complete Phase 3 checkpoint validation"
```

#### Phase 4 - Completion
```
"Execute Phase 4 of the spec migration:
1. Migrate Screen Design (Step 7)
2. Update templates and documentation (Step 8)
3. Archive old documentation (Step 9)
4. Complete Phase 4 checkpoint validation"
```

#### Phase 5 - Validation and Launch
```
"Execute Phase 5 of the spec migration:
1. Perform final validation using spec-migration-quality-checklist.md
2. Conduct team training
3. Complete go-live checklist
4. Document lessons learned"
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### If Content Appears Lost
```
"STOP the migration. Compare the original file [filename] with the migrated documents. Create a mapping table showing where each section went. Do not proceed until all content is accounted for."
```

#### If Confusion About Transformation
```
"Read the specific example in spec-migration-conversion-instructions.md for this document type. If no exact match, use the closest example and document any decisions made."
```

#### If Quality Check Fails
```
"For feature [name], identify which quality criteria failed. Read the relevant section in spec-migration-quality-checklist.md and make the necessary corrections. Re-run the full quality check."
```

This migration plan ensures systematic transformation while preserving all valuable content and improving documentation quality through the spec workflow structure.
