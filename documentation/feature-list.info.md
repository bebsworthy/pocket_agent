## Core Functional Areas for Concurrent Development

Based on the frontend specification analysis, here are the **key functional areas that can be specified and implemented concurrently**:

### 1. **Data Layer & Entity Management** ✅ **[Full Specification Available](./data-layer-entity-management.feat.md)**
**Independent Implementation Area**

## Recommended Concurrent Development Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel Tracks)**
1. **Track A**: Data layer + Entity management + Repository pattern
2. **Track B**: Security framework + Keystore + Biometric auth
3. **Track C**: UI foundation + Navigation + Design system
4. **Track D**: Communication protocols + Message handling

### **Phase 2: Integration (Parallel Tracks)**
1. **Track A**: Chat interface + Real-time messaging
2. **Track B**: Quick actions + Project script discovery
3. **Track C**: File browser + Git integration  
4. **Track D**: Background services + Notifications

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. Progress tracking
2. Performance optimization
3. Accessibility features
4. Voice integration (Future Release)

## Key Benefits of This Approach

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Each area has clear interfaces and can be developed independently
- **Early Testing**: Each component can be unit tested in isolation
- **Parallel Teams**: Different developers can work on different areas simultaneously
- **Risk Mitigation**: Complex areas (SSH, WebSocket) can be prototyped early
- **Incremental Integration**: Components can be integrated as they're completed

## Entity Relationships Summary

**SSH Identity (1) → (N) Server Profile → (N) Project**

### SSH Identity
- Imported SSH private keys stored encrypted
- Multi-server usage capability
- Context separation (work, personal, client)
- Biometric-protected key storage

### Server Profile  
- Connection endpoints and configuration
- Links to specific SSH identity
- Server grouping for multiple projects
- Connection state persistence

### Project
- Individual Claude Code sessions
- Server association and path configuration
- Script integration capabilities
- Independent Claude settings per project

## Technical Architecture

The clean architecture with separate **Presentation/Domain/Data** layers makes this concurrent development approach very feasible, with each functional area having well-defined interfaces and minimal cross-dependencies.
