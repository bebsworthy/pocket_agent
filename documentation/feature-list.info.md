# Claude Code Mobile App - Feature List & Concurrent Development Analysis

## Core Functional Areas for Concurrent Development

Based on the frontend specification analysis, here are the **key functional areas that can be specified and implemented concurrently**:

### 1. **Data Layer & Entity Management** 
**Independent Implementation Area**
- SSH Identity management (key generation, storage)
- Server Profile CRUD operations  
- Project configuration management
- Room database schema and DAOs
- Repository pattern implementation

### 2. **Security & Authentication**
**Independent Implementation Area**
- Android Keystore integration
- Biometric authentication framework
- Token vault implementation
- SSH key pair generation and storage
- Encrypted SharedPreferences setup

### 3. **Communication Layer**
**Independent Implementation Area** 
- WebSocket client implementation (OkHttp3)
- SSH tunnel management (JSch)
- Message protocol handling
- Connection state management
- Reconnection logic with exponential backoff

### 4. **UI Navigation & Foundation**
**Independent Implementation Area**
- Jetpack Compose setup with Material Design 3
- Navigation structure (bottom tabs, app-level navigation)
- Base UI components and design system
- Screen scaffolding for all major screens
- Theme management (dark/light modes)

### 5. **Background Services**
**Independent Implementation Area**
- Foreground service for monitoring
- WorkManager integration
- Notification system setup
- Battery optimization logic
- Connection health polling

### 6. **Voice Integration**
**Independent Implementation Area**
- Speech-to-text implementation
- Text-to-speech integration
- Audio permission handling
- Voice UI components
- Audio feedback systems

## Recommended Concurrent Development Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel Tracks)**
1. **Track A**: Data layer + Entity management + Repository pattern
2. **Track B**: Security framework + Keystore + Biometric auth
3. **Track C**: UI foundation + Navigation + Design system
4. **Track D**: Communication protocols + Message handling

### **Phase 2: Integration (Parallel Tracks)**
1. **Track A**: Chat interface + Real-time messaging
2. **Track B**: Quick actions + Project script discovery
3. **Track C**: File browser + Git integration  
4. **Track D**: Background services + Notifications

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. Voice integration
2. Progress tracking
3. Performance optimization
4. Accessibility features

## Key Benefits of This Approach

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Each area has clear interfaces and can be developed independently
- **Early Testing**: Each component can be unit tested in isolation
- **Parallel Teams**: Different developers can work on different areas simultaneously
- **Risk Mitigation**: Complex areas (SSH, WebSocket) can be prototyped early
- **Incremental Integration**: Components can be integrated as they're completed

## Entity Relationships Summary

**SSH Identity (1) → (N) Server Profile → (N) Project**

### SSH Identity
- Cryptographic key pairs for authentication
- Multi-server usage capability
- Context separation (work, personal, client)
- Hardware-backed security storage

### Server Profile  
- Connection endpoints and configuration
- Links to specific SSH identity
- Server grouping for multiple projects
- Connection state persistence

### Project
- Individual Claude Code sessions
- Server association and path configuration
- Script integration capabilities
- Independent Claude settings per project

## Technical Architecture

The clean architecture with separate **Presentation/Domain/Data** layers makes this concurrent development approach very feasible, with each functional area having well-defined interfaces and minimal cross-dependencies.
