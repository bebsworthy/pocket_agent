## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Data Layer** must be implemented first as it provides the foundation for all other features
2. **Security Authentication** starts early to provide authentication infrastructure
3. **UI Navigation Foundation** begins after basic data and security are in place
4. **Communication Layer** starts after security authentication is partially complete
5. **Screen Design** begins only after UI Navigation Foundation has scaffolding ready
6. **Background Services** can start early but depends on other features for full functionality

## Parallel Development Opportunities

The following phases can be developed in parallel:
- Data Layer testing phases with early UI Navigation Foundation phases
- Security Authentication middle phases with Communication Layer early phases
- Screen Design implementation with Background Services core features
- Documentation phases across all features near the end
