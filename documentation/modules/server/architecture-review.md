# Server Architecture Review Report

## Overview
This report reviews the coherence of the server module architecture.md against the new WebSocket API feature specification.

## Key Inconsistencies Found

### 1. REST API References
- **Issue**: Architecture still mentions "REST API (planned)" multiple times
- **Reality**: WebSocket API spec explicitly states NO REST API
- **Lines**: 7, 17, 23, 57, 92, 106, 120-125

### 2. Claude References
- **Issue**: References "Claude Code" instead of "Claude CLI"
- **Reality**: We now understand it's Claude CLI that executes and exits, not a daemon

### 3. Authentication
- **Issue**: SSH key authentication is still prominently featured
- **Reality**: MVP has no authentication (moved to future work)

### 4. Session Model
- **Issue**: Simple session model without project concept
- **Reality**: Project-based organization is core to the design

### 5. Data Storage
- **Issue**: "No Persistence: Server is stateless" (line 175)
- **Reality**: Server persists projects and messages to disk

### 6. Missing Core Concepts
- Project-based execution model
- Message history with file rotation
- Server restart persistence
- Multi-client subscription model
- New session creation capability

## Recommendations

The architecture.md needs significant updates to align with the WebSocket API specification:

1. Remove all REST API references
2. Update to reflect project-based organization
3. Add persistence layer details
4. Move authentication to future work
5. Update data models to match WebSocket API
6. Add Claude CLI execution model details
