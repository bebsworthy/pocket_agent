# Requirements Document: Application Base

## Introduction

The application-base feature establishes the foundational infrastructure for the frontend-spa module - a mobile-first React Single Page Application. This feature provides the core application structure, component library foundation, routing, state management, WebSocket service, and basic UI screens that all other features will build upon. The application targets mobile web browsers exclusively, with no desktop support at this time.

### Research Context

Research findings indicate:
- The test-client already provides complete TypeScript message types and WebSocket patterns
- Mobile mockups show clear UI patterns for project cards, tab navigation, and connection status
- Server uses a well-defined WebSocket protocol that's simpler than the Android wrapper approach
- No existing React code means full flexibility in establishing patterns
- Mobile-first design is critical with touch-optimized interactions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Setup and Build Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured React SPA project, so that I can build and deploy a mobile web application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL use Vite as the build tool with TypeScript configuration

4. WHEN the app loses connectivity THEN local state SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN storing preferences THEN the system SHALL persist to localStorage

5. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL re-join previously joined projects
6. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
7. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL maintain one connection per server (shared across projects)

### Requirement 6: Dashboard Screen

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my projects and servers, so that I can manage and access them.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN loading the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of saved projects
2. WHEN displaying projects THEN each card SHALL show:
   - Project name
   - Server connection status (connected/disconnected/connecting)
   - Project path
3. WHEN tapping "Add Project" THEN the system SHALL show a form to create a new project
4. WHEN creating a project THEN the user SHALL specify:
   - Project name (required)
   - Project path (required)
   - Server selection (required, with option to add new server)
5. WHEN adding a server THEN the user SHALL specify:
   - Server name (required)
   - WebSocket URL (required, validated format)
6. WHEN viewing servers THEN the system SHALL indicate connection status with visual feedback
7. WHEN the list is empty THEN the system SHALL show an empty state with guidance

### Requirement 7: Project Detail Screen

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view project details and access different features, so that I can work with my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN navigating to a project THEN the system SHALL display the project name in the header
