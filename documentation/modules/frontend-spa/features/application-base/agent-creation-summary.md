### Next Steps
1. Run `/spec:agents application-base --module frontend-spa --optimize` to update tasks.md with agent recommendations
2. Use `/spec:6_execute` to start implementation with specialized agents
3. Agents will automatically be selected based on task requirements

The specialized agents are now ready to provide higher quality implementations compared to using the general-purpose agent for all tasks.
