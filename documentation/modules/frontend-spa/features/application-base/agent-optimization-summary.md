# Agent Optimization Summary

## Tasks Optimized Successfully âœ…

The tasks.md file has been updated with specialized agent assignments for optimal implementation quality.

### Key Changes Made

1. **Replaced general-purpose agent** with specialized agents:
   - `typescript-react-developer` for all React/TypeScript development (17 tasks)
   - `frontend-test-engineer` for testing tasks (2 tasks)

2. **Added consultant agents** for specific expertise:
   - `frontend-architect` consultations on:
     - Track A: Build optimization
     - Track D: State architecture
     - Track F: App architecture
   
   - `ui-accessibility-specialist` consultations on:
     - Track B: Touch targets and ARIA
     - Track C: Mobile interactions
     - Track G: Complex components
     - Track H: Screen layouts
   
   - `go-websocket-specialist` consultation on:
     - Track E: WebSocket protocol guidance

3. **Maintained existing agents**:
   - `code-quality-reviewer` for all review checkpoints (CR1, CR2, CR3)

### Benefits of Optimization

1. **Higher Quality Code**
   - TypeScript expert ensures strict typing and React best practices
   - Architecture consultant prevents design mistakes early
   - Accessibility consultant ensures WCAG compliance

2. **Faster Development**
   - Specialized agents work more efficiently in their domains
   - Less time spent researching unfamiliar patterns
   - Better first-time quality reduces rework

3. **Better Testing**
   - Dedicated test engineer brings testing expertise
   - Modern testing patterns with Vitest and RTL
   - Proper WebSocket mocking strategies

4. **Mobile-First Excellence**
   - UI specialist ensures proper touch targets (44x44px)
   - Accessibility from the start, not retrofitted
   - Performance optimized for mobile devices

### Execution Recommendations

1. **Start with Track A** using typescript-react-developer with frontend-architect consultation
2. **Parallel execution** of Tracks B, C, D, and I after foundation
3. **Leverage consultants** proactively - don't wait for issues
4. **Code reviews** at each checkpoint to maintain quality
