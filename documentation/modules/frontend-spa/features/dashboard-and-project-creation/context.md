## Feature Information
- **Name**: dashboard-and-project-creation
- **Module**: frontend-spa
- **Type**: Single-module feature
- **Status**: Created
- **Created**: 2025-08-01

## Description
The dashboard should list the Project, Connected servers and enable the user to manage (create) Projects and Servers.

## Feature Scope
This feature focuses on creating the main dashboard interface within the frontend-spa module that will:

1. **Display Project Information**
   - List all existing projects
   - Show project status and details
   - Enable project management actions

2. **Display Server Connection Status**
   - Show connected servers
   - Display connection status for each server
   - Provide server connection management

3. **Enable Project Management**
   - Allow users to create new projects
   - Enable project modification and deletion
   - Provide project organization capabilities

4. **Enable Server Management**
   - Allow users to add new servers
   - Configure server connections
   - Manage server credentials and settings

## Module Context
This feature builds upon the **application-base** feature of the frontend-spa module, which provides:
- Core React application structure
- Component library (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- State management with Jotai
- WebSocket service integration
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Error boundaries and theme system

## Integration Points
- **WebSocket Service**: Real-time communication with server for project and server status
- **State Management**: Project and server state management using Jotai atoms
- **Component Library**: Utilizing existing UI components from application-base
- **Local Storage**: Persisting dashboard preferences and cached data

## Success Criteria
- Users can view all projects and their current status
- Users can see connected servers and their connection state
- Users can create new projects through an intuitive interface
- Users can add and configure new server connections
- Dashboard is responsive and works on mobile devices
- Real-time updates reflect project and server state changes

## Dependencies
- **application-base** feature must be completed first
- WebSocket protocol specification from server module
- Project and server data models alignment with server module

## Next Steps
1. Run `/spec:2_research dashboard-and-project-creation` to analyze codebase context
2. Proceed through the spec workflow: research → requirements → design → tasks → execute
