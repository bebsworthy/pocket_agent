# Dashboard and Project Creation - Implementation Tasks

## Available Agents Detected
- **typescript-react-developer**: React 18+, TypeScript, Vite, mobile-first development
- **frontend-test-engineer**: Vitest, React Testing Library, component testing
- **typescript-react-code-reviewer**: Code review specialist for React/TypeScript/mobile
- **ui-accessibility-specialist**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile accessibility
- **product-owner-reviewer**: Requirements validation and specification compliance

## Review and Rework Process
1. After each track's development tasks, a **Code Review (CR)** is performed by the typescript-react-code-reviewer
2. Following the code review, a **Product Review (PR)** is performed by the product-owner-reviewer
3. If either review fails (status: "Requires changes"), a **Rework (RW)** task is triggered
4. The typescript-react-developer addresses all findings from the failed reviews
5. After rework, the review process repeats until approval is achieved
6. Only after both CR and PR are approved can dependent tracks proceed
