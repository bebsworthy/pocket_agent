# Dashboard and Project Creation - Requirements

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the main dashboard interface in the frontend-spa module. The dashboard serves as the primary entry point for users to view, create, and manage projects and server connections through a mobile-optimized interface.

### Research Context

Based on the research analysis and official mockup review (`/documentation/mockups/claude-01/index.html`), this feature leverages existing application-base components with specific enhancements:

- **Existing Foundation**: ProjectCard, ServerForm, EmptyState components are ready to use
- **New Components Needed**: FAB and enhanced ProjectCard with connection status colors  
- **State Management**: useProjects() and useServers() hooks provide complete CRUD operations
- **Simplified Scope**: Git integration and notification badges excluded from this feature

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Projects List Display
**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to view all my projects in a clean, organized list, so that I can quickly see my project portfolio and their connection status.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a projects list with all projects from useProjects() hook
2. WHEN there are no projects THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with folder-off icon and "No projects yet" message
3. WHEN there are projects THEN each project SHALL be displayed as a ProjectCard with connection status colored icons (green=connected, gray=disconnected, yellow=connecting)
4. WHEN a ProjectCard is displayed THEN it SHALL show project name, server name, and last active time
5. WHEN the user taps a ProjectCard THEN the system SHALL navigate to the project detail screen with segmented tabs

### Requirement 2: Project Creation
**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new projects through an intuitive interface, so that I can start working on new development tasks quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the dashboard is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a floating action button (FAB) with plus icon in the bottom-right corner
2. WHEN the FAB is tapped THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen project creation modal
3. WHEN the project creation modal opens THEN it SHALL contain fields for project name, project path, and server selection
4. WHEN the project name field is empty THEN the system SHALL display validation error "Project name is required"
5. WHEN the project path field is empty THEN the system SHALL display validation error "Project path is required"
6. WHEN server selection dropdown is opened THEN it SHALL display all available servers plus "Add New Server" option
7. WHEN "Add New Server" is selected THEN the system SHALL open the ServerForm modal for new server creation
8. WHEN valid project data is submitted THEN the system SHALL create the project using addProject() action and close the modal
9. WHEN the modal is dismissed THEN the system SHALL return to the projects list and clear form data

### Requirement 3: Server Management Integration
**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage server connections directly from the dashboard, so that I can ensure my projects can connect to their respective servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating a new project THEN the system SHALL allow server selection from existing servers via useServers() hook
2. WHEN "Add New Server" is selected during project creation THEN the system SHALL open the existing ServerForm component
3. WHEN a new server is successfully added THEN the system SHALL automatically select it for the current project creation
4. WHEN a server connection status changes THEN the system SHALL update the ProjectCard connection icon color in real-time
5. WHEN a server is disconnected THEN the ProjectCard SHALL display a gray connection icon
6. WHEN a server is connecting THEN the ProjectCard SHALL display a yellow connection icon
7. WHEN a server is connected THEN the ProjectCard SHALL display a green connection icon

### Requirement 4: Mobile-First Responsive Design
**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the dashboard to work seamlessly on my phone, so that I can manage projects efficiently on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the dashboard is displayed on mobile devices THEN all touch targets SHALL be minimum 44px in size
2. WHEN the dashboard is displayed THEN it SHALL use mobile-first container with max-width constraint
3. WHEN the FAB is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned with appropriate margin from screen edges (24px)
4. WHEN modals are displayed THEN they SHALL be full-screen on mobile with proper safe area handling
5. WHEN animations are triggered THEN they SHALL maintain 60fps performance on mobile devices
6. WHEN theme is toggled THEN the dashboard SHALL support light/dark theme switching with system preference detection

### Requirement 5: Real-time Updates
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates of project and server status, so that I always have current information about my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a server connection status changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the corresponding ProjectCard connection icon
2. WHEN a new project is added via WebSocket THEN the system SHALL add it to the projects list without requiring page refresh  
3. WHEN a project is deleted remotely THEN the system SHALL remove it from the projects list in real-time
4. WHEN WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the disconnection without crashing
5. WHEN WebSocket connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync project and server states
6. WHEN multiple users modify projects THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates with optimistic UI updates

### Requirement 6: Navigation and User Experience
**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive navigation between the dashboard and project details, so that I can efficiently move between different areas of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the app bar SHALL display "Pocket Agent" title with menu icon and theme toggle
2. WHEN a project is selected THEN the system SHALL navigate to project detail screen with back arrow in app bar
3. WHEN the back arrow is tapped THEN the system SHALL return to the projects list dashboard
4. WHEN project detail screen is displayed THEN it SHALL show segmented control tabs: Chat, Files, Monitor, Settings
5. WHEN segmented tabs are used THEN the system SHALL maintain tab state during project session
6. WHEN keyboard input is focused in project detail THEN the system SHALL handle mobile keyboard display appropriately
7. WHEN swipe gestures are performed on project detail THEN the system SHALL switch between tabs (if implemented)

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Edge Cases
**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue working even when network or server issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN project creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and allow retry
2. WHEN server connection test fails THEN the system SHALL show connection error with retry option
3. WHEN localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display storage error boundary with data export option
4. WHEN WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL show connection status and attempt automatic reconnection
5. WHEN an empty project name is submitted THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight the error
6. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue operations and sync when connection returns
7. WHEN browser tab is restored THEN the system SHALL reload project and server states from localStorage

### Requirement 8: Performance and Optimization
