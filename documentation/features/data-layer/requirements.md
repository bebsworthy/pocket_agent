4.5. WHEN storing messages THEN the system SHALL preserve timestamp and metadata

### Story 5: Performance and Memory
**As a** mobile app user  
**I want** the app to respond quickly and use minimal battery

5.1. WHEN app loads data THEN the system SHALL cache entire dataset in memory
5.2. IF memory pressure occurs THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle with appropriate limits
5.3. WHEN performing data operations THEN the system SHALL complete within 100ms for cached data
5.4. IF file operations are needed THEN the system SHALL perform them asynchronously
5.5. WHEN app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL minimize memory usage

### Story 6: Data Search and Query
**As a** mobile app user  
**I want** to quickly find my projects and servers  
**So that** I can navigate efficiently between different environments

#### Acceptance Criteria
6.1. WHEN user searches for projects THEN the system SHALL return results within 50ms
6.2. IF search query matches name or path THEN the system SHALL include in results
6.3. WHEN displaying projects THEN the system SHALL sort by last active date
6.4. IF user has many projects THEN the system SHALL provide recent projects list
6.5. WHEN filtering by server THEN the system SHALL show only associated projects

### Story 7: Data Export and Backup
**As a** mobile app user  
**I want** to backup and restore my configurations  
**So that** I can transfer to new devices or recover from issues

#### Acceptance Criteria
7.1. WHEN user requests export THEN the system SHALL create JSON backup of all data
7.2. IF user provides import file THEN the system SHALL validate before importing
7.3. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL check for conflicts and duplicates
7.4. IF Android backup is enabled THEN the system SHALL include encrypted data file
7.5. WHEN backup occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain encryption throughout

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
1. Initial data load SHALL complete within 500ms
2. Cached data access SHALL complete within 10ms
3. Data save operations SHALL complete within 200ms
4. Memory usage SHALL NOT exceed 50MB for typical dataset
5. Search operations SHALL return results within 50ms

### Security Requirements
1. All sensitive data SHALL be encrypted using AES-256-GCM
2. Encryption keys SHALL be stored in Android Keystore
3. Data at rest SHALL remain encrypted at all times
4. Memory containing sensitive data SHALL be cleared after use
5. Biometric authentication SHALL be required for data access

### Reliability Requirements
1. System SHALL maintain data integrity through atomic operations
2. Automatic backups SHALL occur before each write operation
3. Data corruption SHALL be detected through validation
4. Recovery from backup SHALL be automatic on corruption
5. No data loss SHALL occur during normal operations

### Scalability Requirements
1. System SHALL support up to 50 SSH identities
2. System SHALL support up to 100 server profiles
3. System SHALL support up to 200 projects
