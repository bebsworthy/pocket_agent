# Data Layer - Research

## Executive Summary

Research indicates that for Pocket Agent's expected data volume (10-20 servers, 50-100 projects, ~1000 messages per project), an encrypted JSON file with in-memory caching provides the optimal balance of simplicity, performance, and security. This approach leverages Android's mature Keystore system for encryption while avoiding the complexity overhead of SQL databases for a dataset that easily fits in memory.

## Pattern Analysis

### Applicable Patterns

1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Description: Abstracts data source behind interface
   - Usage in codebase: Not yet implemented
   - Applicability: Perfect fit for data layer abstraction

2. **In-Memory Cache Pattern**
   - Description: Cache entire dataset in memory after load
   - Usage in codebase: Used in message history
   - Applicability: Ideal for small dataset that fits in memory

3. **Atomic File Operations**
   - Description: Write to temp file, then rename for atomicity
   - Usage in codebase: Not yet implemented
   - Applicability: Critical for data integrity

4. **Observer Pattern with Flow**
   - Description: Reactive updates using Kotlin Flow
   - Usage in codebase: Extensively used in ViewModels
   - Applicability: Enable real-time UI updates when data changes

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Over-Engineering**: Avoid complex ORM for simple data structures
2. **Frequent File I/O**: Cache aggressively to reduce battery impact
3. **Synchronous Operations**: All data operations must be async
4. **Large Memory Footprint**: Implement message trimming to control size

## Technology Evaluation

### Option 1: Encrypted JSON File
- **Pros**: 
  - Simple implementation with Kotlinx.serialization 1.6.0+
  - Easy backup/restore with single file
  - Excellent performance for small datasets
  - Natural fit for hierarchical data model
- **Cons**: 
  - Limited query capabilities
  - Entire file rewritten on changes
- **Verdict**: Selected - optimal for expected data volume

### Option 2: SQLite Database
- **Pros**: 
  - Powerful query capabilities
  - Partial updates possible
  - Established Android pattern
- **Cons**: 
  - Complex schema migrations
  - ORM overhead (Room 2.6.0+)
  - Overkill for small dataset
- **Verdict**: Rejected - unnecessary complexity

### Option 3: DataStore (Proto/Preferences)
- **Pros**: 
  - Google's modern recommendation
  - Built-in Flow support
- **Cons**: 
  - Proto DataStore requires schema definition
  - Preferences DataStore limited to primitives
- **Verdict**: Rejected - not suitable for complex objects

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| Data corruption | Low | High | Atomic writes + automatic backups |
| Memory pressure | Medium | Medium | Message limiting + trimming |
| Concurrent access | Medium | High | Mutex-based synchronization |
| Large file size | Low | Medium | GZIP compression if needed |

### Implementation Complexity
- Estimated effort: 1 week for core implementation
- Key challenges: 
  - Ensuring thread-safe operations
  - Handling data migration gracefully
  - Optimizing memory usage
- Required expertise: 
  - Kotlin coroutines
  - Android file system
  - Encryption APIs

## Recommendations

1. **Architecture**: Repository pattern with in-memory cache
2. **Technology Stack**: 
   - Kotlinx.serialization 1.6.0+ for JSON
   - Android Keystore for encryption
   - Kotlin Coroutines 1.7.0+ for async
   - StateFlow for reactive updates
3. **Implementation Strategy**: 
   - Phase 1: Core repository with basic CRUD
   - Phase 2: Reactive flows and observers  
   - Phase 3: Backup and migration support
4. **Testing Strategy**: 
   - Unit tests with mock encryption
   - Integration tests for persistence
   - Performance tests for large datasets
