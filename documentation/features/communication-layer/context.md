# Communication Layer - Context

## Overview

The Communication Layer provides the foundation for real-time, bidirectional communication between the Pocket Agent mobile application and Claude Code wrapper services running on development machines. This feature enables developers to interact with Claude from their mobile devices, maintaining secure connections across different network conditions.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Developers often need to monitor and interact with their Claude Code sessions while away from their development machines. Current solutions require being physically present at the machine or using complex remote desktop solutions that are impractical on mobile devices. This creates several challenges:

- **Mobility Gap**: Developers cannot respond to Claude's permission requests or monitor progress when away from their desk
- **Security Concerns**: Traditional remote access methods expose entire systems rather than just Claude interactions
- **Network Reliability**: Mobile networks are inherently unstable, requiring robust connection management
- **Authentication Complexity**: Secure authentication from mobile devices needs to be both strong and user-friendly

### Target Users

1. **Mobile Developers**: Need to monitor long-running tasks or respond to Claude while commuting or in meetings
2. **DevOps Engineers**: Require ability to approve sensitive operations from verified mobile devices
3. **Team Leads**: Want to review Claude's work and provide guidance without returning to their workstation
4. **Remote Workers**: Need secure access to development sessions from various locations

### Business Value

- **Increased Productivity**: Developers can maintain workflow continuity regardless of location
- **Faster Response Times**: Critical permissions can be approved immediately, preventing workflow blocks
- **Enhanced Security**: SSH key-based authentication provides stronger security than password-based systems
- **Operational Flexibility**: Teams can collaborate on Claude sessions across different time zones and locations

## User Perspective

### User Goals

1. **Stay Connected**: Maintain reliable connection to Claude sessions despite network changes
2. **Secure Access**: Ensure only authorized devices can connect to development machines
3. **Quick Actions**: Approve or deny permissions with minimal friction
4. **Progress Monitoring**: View real-time updates on Claude's activities
5. **Session Continuity**: Resume conversations seamlessly after disconnections

### Key Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Permission Approval During Meeting
Sarah is in a team meeting when Claude requests permission to modify database schemas. She receives a notification on her phone, reviews the proposed changes, and approves the action without interrupting the meeting or returning to her desk.

#### Scenario 2: Monitoring Long-Running Tasks
John starts a large refactoring task with Claude before leaving for lunch. He monitors progress from his phone, seeing real-time updates as Claude works through the codebase. When Claude encounters an ambiguous case, John can provide clarification immediately.

#### Scenario 3: Network Transition
Maria commutes by train, experiencing multiple network transitions between cellular towers and Wi-Fi. The app maintains her session throughout, queuing her messages during brief disconnections and automatically resuming when connectivity returns.

#### Scenario 4: Emergency Response
David receives an urgent notification that Claude has encountered a critical error in production code. He securely connects from his phone, reviews the situation, and guides Claude through the fix, preventing extended downtime.

### Success Criteria

From the user's perspective, the Communication Layer succeeds when:

1. **Connection Reliability**: 99% uptime during normal network conditions
2. **Message Delivery**: All messages reach their destination, even after temporary disconnections
3. **Authentication Speed**: SSH key authentication completes in under 3 seconds
4. **Permission Response Time**: Users can respond to permission requests within 30 seconds
5. **Session Persistence**: Conversations resume seamlessly after app restarts or network changes

## Technical Context

### Integration Points

1. **Claude Code Wrapper**: WebSocket server running on development machines
2. **SSH Key Infrastructure**: Existing SSH keys for authentication
3. **Android System Services**: Network monitoring, battery optimization, notifications
4. **Background Services**: Foreground service for persistent connections
5. **Security Layer**: Biometric authentication and encrypted storage

### Constraints

1. **Mobile Network Limitations**: Variable latency, frequent disconnections, bandwidth restrictions
2. **Battery Life**: Continuous connections must be balanced with power consumption
3. **Security Requirements**: All communications must be encrypted and authenticated
4. **Android Platform**: Must work within Android's background execution limits
5. **Message Size**: Mobile data plans require efficient message protocols

### Dependencies

- WebSocket protocol support (OkHttp library)
- SSH key cryptography (Bouncy Castle)
- Kotlin coroutines for async operations
- Android WorkManager for background tasks
- Notification system for permission requests

## Expected Outcomes

### For Users

1. **Continuous Productivity**: Work with Claude from anywhere without interruption
2. **Peace of Mind**: Secure authentication prevents unauthorized access
3. **Responsive Control**: Immediate notification and response to Claude's requests
4. **Reliable Experience**: Consistent performance across varying network conditions

### For Development Teams

1. **Reduced Downtime**: Faster response to Claude's permission requests
2. **Improved Collaboration**: Multiple team members can monitor same session
3. **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged for compliance and debugging
4. **Flexible Workflows**: Support for both attended and unattended operation modes

### For the Organization

1. **Competitive Advantage**: First-to-market mobile Claude integration
2. **Security Compliance**: Enterprise-grade authentication and encryption
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced need for VPN or remote desktop solutions
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports thousands of concurrent connections

## Scope Definition

### In Scope

- WebSocket connection management with authentication
- SSH key-based challenge-response authentication
- Message protocol for Claude interactions
- Connection state persistence and recovery
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Permission request handling and responses
