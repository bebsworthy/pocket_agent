# Communication Layer - Cross-Module Context

## Overview

The Communication Layer provides the foundation for real-time, bidirectional communication between Pocket Agent client applications (Android mobile, React web) and Claude Code wrapper services running on development machines. This cross-module feature enables developers to interact with Claude from any supported client device, maintaining secure connections across different network conditions.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Developers often need to monitor and interact with their Claude Code sessions while away from their development machines or when using different types of devices. Current solutions require being physically present at the machine or using complex remote desktop solutions that are impractical on mobile devices or limited web interfaces. This creates several challenges:

- **Mobility Gap**: Developers cannot respond to Claude's permission requests or monitor progress when away from their desk
- **Device Flexibility**: Need to access Claude from both mobile and web interfaces seamlessly
- **Security Concerns**: Traditional remote access methods expose entire systems rather than just Claude interactions
- **Network Reliability**: Mobile and web networks are inherently unstable, requiring robust connection management
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Different client platforms need consistent experience and capabilities

### Target Users

1. **Mobile Developers**: Need to monitor long-running tasks or respond to Claude while commuting or in meetings
2. **Web Users**: Prefer browser-based access for quick interactions or when mobile app isn't available
3. **DevOps Engineers**: Require ability to approve sensitive operations from verified devices
4. **Team Leads**: Want to review Claude's work from any available device
5. **Remote Workers**: Need secure access to development sessions from various locations and devices

### Business Value

- **Increased Productivity**: Developers can maintain workflow continuity regardless of device or location
- **Faster Response Times**: Critical permissions can be approved immediately from any client
- **Enhanced Security**: Consistent SSH key-based authentication across all platforms
- **Operational Flexibility**: Teams can collaborate on Claude sessions across different devices and platforms
- **User Choice**: Flexibility to use preferred device type (mobile or web) for different scenarios

## Cross-Module Architecture

### Module Responsibilities

#### Server Module
- **WebSocket Server**: Provides the central communication hub
- **Authentication**: Validates SSH keys and manages sessions
- **Message Routing**: Routes messages between Claude Code and connected clients
- **Session Management**: Tracks active sessions and client connections
- **Protocol Implementation**: Defines and enforces the communication protocol

#### Frontend-Android Module
- **Mobile Client**: Native Android WebSocket client optimized for mobile networks
- **Background Connectivity**: Maintains connections during app backgrounding
- **Mobile UX**: Touch-optimized interface for permission approvals
- **Offline Handling**: Queues messages and handles disconnections gracefully
- **Battery Optimization**: Manages connection frequency based on battery state

#### Frontend-React Module
- **Web Client**: Browser-based WebSocket client for desktop/tablet access
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and input methods
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works across modern browsers with WebSocket support
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains sessions across browser tabs and refreshes
- **Real-time Updates**: Provides instant feedback and notifications in browser

## Integration Scenarios

### Cross-Device Handoff
A developer starts a Claude session on their desktop, monitors progress on mobile during a meeting, then switches to web interface for detailed code review.

### Multi-Client Monitoring
Team leads can observe the same Claude session from both web dashboard and mobile notifications, receiving updates on any device.

### Platform-Specific Optimization
- **Mobile**: Optimized for quick permission approvals and status monitoring
- **Web**: Optimized for detailed interaction and code review

## Success Criteria

### Cross-Module Integration
1. **Protocol Consistency**: Same message format works across all client types
2. **Feature Parity**: Core functionality available on all platforms
3. **Seamless Switching**: Users can switch between clients without losing context
4. **Synchronized State**: All connected clients show consistent session state

### Platform-Specific Performance
- **Mobile**: Sub-3-second authentication, 99% uptime during normal networks
- **Web**: Instant connection establishment, real-time updates without refresh
- **Server**: Handle 100+ concurrent connections, sub-100ms message routing

## Module Integration Points

### Shared Protocol
- **Message Format**: JSON-based protocol understood by all modules
- **Authentication Flow**: SSH key challenge-response across all clients
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error codes and recovery strategies
- **Session Management**: Unified session lifecycle across platforms

### Platform-Specific Adaptations
- **Mobile**: Connection persistence during network changes
- **Web**: Browser security model compliance
- **Server**: Multi-client session broadcasting
