2. WHEN device sleeps THEN connection uses battery-optimized polling
3. WHEN critical message arrives THEN app wakes device with notification
4. WHEN returning to app THEN conversation state is preserved
5. IF background restrictions apply THEN user is guided to whitelist app

### Story 6: Offline Message Queuing
**As a** mobile user with unstable connectivity
**I want** messages to be queued when offline
**So that** I don't lose communication with Claude Code

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN connection lost THEN messages are queued locally
2. WHEN typing offline THEN user sees offline indicator
3. WHEN connection restored THEN queued messages are sent automatically
4. WHEN messages sent THEN user sees delivery confirmation
5. IF queue exceeds limit THEN oldest messages are discarded with warning

### Story 7: Battery-Aware Connection Management
**As a** mobile user concerned about battery life
**I want** connection management to optimize for battery usage
**So that** the app doesn't drain my battery excessively

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN battery low THEN connection frequency is reduced automatically
