# Communication Layer - Server Requirements

## User Stories

### Story 1: WebSocket Server Setup
**As a** developer
**I want** a WebSocket server that can accept client connections
**So that** I can communicate with Claude Code from client applications

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN server starts THEN WebSocket endpoint is available at configurable port
2. WHEN client connects THEN server accepts WebSocket upgrade request
3. WHEN multiple clients connect THEN server maintains separate connection contexts
4. WHEN server stops THEN all client connections are gracefully closed
5. IF connection limit reached THEN server rejects new connections with appropriate error

### Story 2: Authentication Challenge-Response
**As a** server administrator
**I want** SSH key-based authentication for client connections
**So that** only authorized users can access Claude Code sessions

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN client connects THEN server sends authentication challenge
2. WHEN client provides SSH signature THEN server validates against authorized keys
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN client is marked as authenticated
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN connection is terminated with error message
5. IF client doesn't authenticate within timeout THEN connection is closed

### Story 3: Claude Code Process Management
**As a** server operator
**I want** the server to manage Claude Code process lifecycle
**So that** client commands are properly routed to Claude Code

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN server starts THEN Claude Code process is spawned with appropriate arguments
2. WHEN client sends command THEN server forwards to Claude Code via stdin
3. WHEN Claude Code outputs response THEN server parses and routes to clients
4. WHEN Claude Code process exits THEN server handles cleanup and restart
5. IF Claude Code becomes unresponsive THEN server implements timeout and restart

### Story 4: Multi-Client Session Broadcasting
**As a** developer using multiple devices
**I want** all my connected clients to receive the same session updates
**So that** I can seamlessly switch between devices

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Claude Code sends output THEN all authenticated clients receive the message
2. WHEN permission request occurs THEN all clients are notified simultaneously
3. WHEN one client responds to permission THEN other clients are updated
4. WHEN session state changes THEN all clients receive state update
5. IF client disconnects THEN session continues for remaining clients

### Story 5: Connection Health Monitoring
**As a** system administrator
**I want** the server to monitor client connection health
**So that** dead connections are cleaned up and sessions remain stable

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN connection is established THEN heartbeat mechanism is initiated
2. WHEN client responds to ping THEN connection is marked as healthy
3. WHEN client doesn't respond to ping THEN connection is marked as stale
4. WHEN connection is stale beyond threshold THEN connection is terminated
5. IF connection terminates unexpectedly THEN session state is preserved for reconnection

### Story 6: Message Protocol Implementation
**As a** client developer
**I want** a well-defined message protocol
**So that** I can implement compatible clients

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN message is received THEN server validates message format and type
2. WHEN message is invalid THEN server responds with structured error
3. WHEN broadcasting message THEN server uses consistent JSON format
4. WHEN session context required THEN server includes session ID in messages
5. IF message type unknown THEN server logs warning and responds with error

### Story 7: Error Handling and Recovery
**As a** server operator
**I want** robust error handling throughout the communication layer
**So that** the system recovers gracefully from failures

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN network error occurs THEN server logs error with context
2. WHEN Claude Code process crashes THEN server restarts process automatically
3. WHEN client sends malformed message THEN server responds with clear error
4. WHEN system resource limits reached THEN server degrades gracefully
5. IF unrecoverable error occurs THEN server shuts down cleanly
