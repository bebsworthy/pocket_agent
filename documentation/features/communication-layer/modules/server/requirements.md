# Communication Layer - Server Requirements

## User Stories

### Story 1: WebSocket Server Setup
**As a** developer
**I want** a WebSocket server that can accept client connections
**So that** I can communicate with Claude CLI from client applications

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN server starts THEN WebSocket endpoint is available at configurable port
2. WHEN client connects THEN server accepts WebSocket upgrade request immediately (no auth)
3. WHEN multiple clients connect THEN server maintains separate connection contexts
4. WHEN server stops THEN all client connections are gracefully closed
5. IF connection limit reached THEN server rejects new connections with appropriate error

### Story 2: Project Management
**As a** developer
**I want** to organize Claude executions by project directory
**So that** I can maintain separate contexts for different work

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN client creates project THEN server validates absolute path exists
2. WHEN project is created THEN unique ID is assigned and metadata persisted
3. WHEN client lists projects THEN all active projects are returned
4. WHEN client deletes project THEN project and message history are removed
5. IF project path is invalid or nested THEN appropriate error is returned

### Story 3: Claude CLI Execution
**As a** developer
**I want** the server to execute Claude CLI commands per project
**So that** I can maintain context across multiple prompts

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN execution requested THEN server runs `claude -p "prompt" -c session_id`
2. WHEN Claude responds THEN server parses JSON output and saves to message log
3. WHEN execution completes THEN session ID is updated for next command
4. WHEN execution exceeds 5 minutes THEN process is killed with timeout error
5. IF Claude CLI is not found THEN appropriate error is returned

### Story 4: Multi-Client Project Subscription
**As a** developer using multiple devices
**I want** all my connected clients to receive updates for subscribed projects
**So that** I can monitor project execution from any device

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN client joins project THEN added to project subscribers list
2. WHEN execution produces output THEN all subscribers receive update
3. WHEN client leaves project THEN removed from subscribers list
4. WHEN project state changes THEN all subscribers notified
5. IF all clients leave project THEN project remains active

### Story 5: Connection Health Monitoring
**As a** system administrator
**I want** the server to monitor client connection health
**So that** dead connections are cleaned up and projects remain accessible

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN connection is established THEN heartbeat mechanism is initiated
2. WHEN client responds to ping THEN connection is marked as healthy
3. WHEN client doesn't respond to ping THEN connection is marked as stale
4. WHEN connection is stale beyond threshold THEN connection is terminated
5. IF connection terminates unexpectedly THEN client removed from project subscribers

### Story 6: Message Persistence and History
**As a** developer
**I want** all project messages persisted to disk
**So that** I can review execution history and survive server restarts

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN message is sent or received THEN appended to project message log
2. WHEN message log exceeds 1GB THEN automatic rotation occurs
3. WHEN messages older than 30 days THEN automatic cleanup
4. WHEN client queries history THEN messages returned by timestamp range
5. IF server restarts THEN all project state recovered from disk

### Story 7: Error Handling and Recovery
**As a** server operator
**I want** robust error handling throughout the system
**So that** the server recovers gracefully from failures

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN network error occurs THEN server logs error with context
2. WHEN Claude CLI execution fails THEN error saved to message log
3. WHEN client sends malformed message THEN server responds with clear error
4. WHEN system resource limits reached THEN server degrades gracefully
5. IF server crashes THEN restart loads all projects from metadata files
