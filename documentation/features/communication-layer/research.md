# Communication Layer - Research

## Executive Summary

The Communication Layer is the foundational component that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the Pocket Agent mobile application and Claude Code wrapper services. After comprehensive analysis of the codebase and evaluation of multiple communication protocols, we recommend implementing a WebSocket-based architecture with SSH key authentication. This approach provides the optimal balance of security, performance, and mobile device compatibility while maintaining consistency with existing authentication patterns in the codebase.

Key findings indicate that WebSocket protocol offers superior battery efficiency compared to polling alternatives, SSH key authentication aligns with developer workflows, and the existing Kotlin coroutine infrastructure provides an ideal foundation for implementing reactive message flows. The architecture should prioritize connection reliability through exponential backoff strategies, message persistence during offline periods, and adaptive behavior based on network conditions. These recommendations ensure a robust communication layer that can handle the challenges of mobile networking while providing a seamless user experience.

## Technology Analysis

### WebSocket Protocol Selection

#### Why WebSocket?

After evaluating multiple real-time communication protocols, WebSocket was chosen for the following reasons:

1. **Bidirectional Communication**: Unlike HTTP polling, WebSocket provides true bidirectional communication, essential for real-time Claude interactions
2. **Low Latency**: Persistent connections eliminate handshake overhead for each message
3. **Mobile Efficiency**: Reduces battery consumption compared to polling or Server-Sent Events
4. **Wide Support**: Native support in OkHttp library and modern Android versions
5. **Firewall Friendly**: Uses standard HTTP/HTTPS ports, improving connectivity success

#### Alternatives Considered

- **HTTP Long Polling**: Rejected due to high battery consumption and latency
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: One-way communication insufficient for interactive sessions
- **gRPC Streaming**: Additional complexity without significant benefits for our use case
- **MQTT**: Overkill for point-to-point communication, adds unnecessary broker complexity

### Authentication Strategy

#### SSH Key Authentication Benefits

1. **Security Strength**: Cryptographically stronger than password-based systems
2. **User Familiarity**: Developers already use SSH keys for Git and server access
3. **No Password Storage**: Eliminates risk of password leaks or weak passwords
4. **Automation Friendly**: Enables secure unattended operation
5. **Audit Trail**: Each key can be uniquely identified and tracked

#### Implementation Approach

Based on analysis of existing authentication patterns in `app/src/main/java/com/pocketagent/data/entity/SshIdentityEntity.kt` and `app/src/main/java/com/pocketagent/security/SshKeyImportManager.kt`, the codebase reveals a challenge-response pattern using SSH keys:

```kotlin
// From app/src/main/java/com/pocketagent/communication/auth/SshKeyAuthenticator.kt
data class AuthChallenge(
    val nonce: String,
    val timestamp: Long,
    val serverVersion: String
)

data class AuthResponse(
    val publicKey: String,
    val signature: String,  // nonce+timestamp signed with private key
    val clientVersion: String
)
```

This approach prevents replay attacks while maintaining compatibility with standard SSH key formats.

### Message Protocol Design

#### Serialization Choice: Kotlinx.serialization

The codebase uses Kotlinx.serialization for several advantages:

1. **Type Safety**: Compile-time verification of message structures
2. **Performance**: Faster than reflection-based solutions
3. **Multiplatform**: Supports potential iOS client in future
4. **JSON Compatibility**: Human-readable for debugging
5. **Polymorphic Support**: Handles sealed class hierarchies elegantly

#### Message Type Hierarchy

```kotlin
sealed class Message {
    abstract val id: String
    abstract val timestamp: Long
    abstract val type: ProtocolMessageType
}
```

This design ensures:
- Every message is uniquely identifiable
- Temporal ordering is preserved
- Type discrimination is explicit

### Connection Reliability Patterns

#### Exponential Backoff Implementation

The reconnection manager (to be implemented in `app/src/main/java/com/pocketagent/communication/reconnect/ReconnectionManager.kt`) implements a sophisticated backoff strategy:

```kotlin
private fun calculateBackoffDelay(attempt: Int): Long {
    val exponentialDelay = INITIAL_DELAY_MS * Math.pow(BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER, (attempt - 1).toDouble()).toLong()
    val boundedDelay = min(exponentialDelay, MAX_DELAY_MS)
    
    // Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
    val jitter = (boundedDelay * JITTER_FACTOR * Random.nextDouble()).toLong()
    
    return boundedDelay + jitter
}
```

Key insights:
- Jitter prevents synchronized reconnection attempts
- Maximum delay cap prevents excessive wait times
- Attempt counting enables circuit breaker patterns

#### Message Queue Persistence

The MessageQueueManager (to be implemented in `app/src/main/java/com/pocketagent/communication/queue/MessageQueueManager.kt`) implements priority-based queuing:

```kotlin
enum class MessagePriority {
    HIGH,    // Permission responses, critical operations
    NORMAL,  // Regular messages
    LOW      // Status updates, non-critical
}
```

This ensures critical messages (like permission responses) are delivered first after reconnection.

### Network Optimization Strategies

#### Adaptive Connection Management

Based on Android's NetworkCallback API (to be implemented in `app/src/main/java/com/pocketagent/communication/network/NetworkObserver.kt`):

```kotlin
fun observeNetworkConnectivity(): Flow<Boolean> = callbackFlow {
    val connectivityManager = context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE) as ConnectivityManager
    
    val callback = object : ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback() {
        override fun onAvailable(network: Network) {
            trySend(true)
        }
        
        override fun onLost(network: Network) {
            trySend(false)
        }
    }
```

This enables:
- Immediate reconnection on network availability
- Graceful handling of network transitions
- Battery-efficient network monitoring

#### Ping/Pong Health Monitoring

WebSocket ping frames maintain connection liveness:

```kotlin
private const val PING_INTERVAL_MS = 30000L // 30 seconds
private const val PONG_TIMEOUT_MS = 10000L // 10 seconds
```

These intervals balance:
- Connection reliability detection
- Battery consumption
- Server resource usage

### Security Considerations

#### Certificate Pinning

The CertificateValidator (to be implemented in `app/src/main/java/com/pocketagent/communication/security/CertificateValidator.kt`) supports optional certificate pinning:

```kotlin
fun getCertificatePinner(url: String): CertificatePinner {
    val host = extractHost(url)
    val pins = trustedCertificates[host] ?: emptyList()
    
    val builder = CertificatePinner.Builder()
    pins.forEach { pin ->
        builder.add(host, pin)
    }
    
    return builder.build()
}
```

This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks on high-security deployments.

#### Audit Logging

All security-relevant events are logged:

```kotlin
fun logAuthenticationAttempt(success: Boolean, error: String? = null)
fun logWebSocketConnection(serverUrl: String, authenticated: Boolean, error: String? = null)
fun logPermissionDecision(requestId: String, approved: Boolean, policyType: PolicyType)
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Coroutine-Based Architecture

The entire communication layer uses Kotlin coroutines for:

1. **Structured Concurrency**: Proper lifecycle management
2. **Backpressure Handling**: Flow-based message streams
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal thread usage
4. **Cancellation Support**: Clean shutdown on disconnection

#### Message Batching Opportunities

While not currently implemented, the architecture supports future message batching:

```kotlin
// Potential enhancement
suspend fun sendBatch(messages: List<Message>) {
    val batchMessage = BatchMessage(messages)
    sendMessage(batchMessage)
}
```

### Platform Integration

#### Android-Specific Optimizations

1. **Doze Mode Compatibility**: Foreground service ensures reliable operation
2. **Data Saver Awareness**: Respects user's data preferences
3. **Battery Optimization**: Adaptive behavior based on battery state
4. **Network Type Detection**: Different strategies for WiFi vs cellular

#### Background Execution Limits

The communication layer works within Android's constraints:

- Uses foreground service for persistent connections
- Implements WorkManager for deferred operations
- Respects app standby buckets
- Handles process death gracefully
