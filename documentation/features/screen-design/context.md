# Screen Design - Context

## Business Context

The Screen Design feature represents the visual interface through which developers interact with Pocket Agent, defining every screen, interaction pattern, and visual element in the mobile application. This comprehensive design system ensures that complex developer workflows are presented in an intuitive, accessible, and efficient manner on mobile devices.

### The Mobile Developer Interface Challenge

Creating a mobile interface for developer tools presents unique challenges:

1. **Information Density**: How to display technical information without overwhelming small screens
2. **Interaction Complexity**: How to enable complex operations with touch interfaces
3. **Context Switching**: How to maintain workflow continuity across multiple screens
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: How to prioritize information for quick decision-making
5. **Professional Aesthetics**: How to create an interface that feels both powerful and approachable

### User Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: First-Time Setup
Rachel, a senior developer, downloads Pocket Agent:
- Experiences a smooth onboarding flow that guides her through SSH key import
- Easily adds her development server with clear form fields and helpful hints
- Creates her first project with an intuitive multi-step wizard
- Feels confident about the app's capabilities from the professional design

#### Scenario 2: Daily Project Management
Kevin manages multiple Claude sessions throughout his workday:
- Quickly identifies project status through clear visual indicators
- Efficiently switches between projects using familiar navigation patterns
- Responds to permission requests with prominent, actionable notifications
- Tracks multiple operations through well-organized progress indicators

#### Scenario 3: Mobile Code Review
Aisha reviews Claude's code changes on her commute:
- Reads syntax-highlighted code blocks with proper formatting
- Navigates file structures using an intuitive browser interface
- Tracks git changes through clear status indicators
- Approves changes with confidence thanks to clear action buttons

#### Scenario 4: Emergency Debugging
Tom receives an alert about a production issue:
- Quickly connects to the relevant project from the home screen
- Uses the chat interface to investigate with Claude
- Reviews system logs in a readable terminal-style display
- Takes decisive action with prominent emergency controls

### Success Criteria

The Screen Design succeeds when:

1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Users find any feature within 3 taps
2. **Clear Information**: Technical data is readable and well-organized
