# Background Services - Context

## Overview

The Background Services feature provides the persistent infrastructure that enables Pocket Agent to maintain continuous monitoring of Claude Code sessions, deliver timely notifications, and execute scheduled maintenance tasks. This feature ensures users never miss important permission requests or task completions, even when the app is not actively in use.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Mobile developers using Claude Code face a critical challenge: their AI assistant often needs permissions or encounters issues while they're away from their desk. Without persistent background monitoring, developers miss:

- **Time-Sensitive Permissions**: Claude waits idle when it needs approval to proceed
- **Task Completions**: No awareness when long-running tasks finish
- **Connection Failures**: Silent failures go unnoticed until manually checked
- **Resource Issues**: Server running out of memory or disk space

Android's battery optimization features make this challenge even more complex, as apps are aggressively restricted from running in the background to preserve battery life.

### Target Users

1. **Active Developers**: Need real-time notifications while multitasking on their device
2. **Remote Workers**: Monitor long-running operations during commutes or meetings  
3. **Team Leads**: Track multiple projects across their development team
4. **On-Call Engineers**: Immediate alerts for production issues Claude discovers

### Business Value

- **Reduced Idle Time**: Claude continues working instead of waiting for permissions
- **Improved Productivity**: Developers can multitask without losing Claude progress
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Prevent server crashes through proactive monitoring
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Automatic recovery from transient connection issues
- **Cost Savings**: Avoid wasted compute time from stalled Claude sessions

## User Perspective

### User Goals

1. **Never Miss Critical Requests**: Receive immediate notifications for permission requests
2. **Stay Informed**: Know when tasks complete or errors occur
3. **Minimize Battery Impact**: Background monitoring without draining the battery
4. **Reliable Operation**: Service continues even after app updates or device restarts
5. **Flexible Control**: Adjust monitoring frequency based on current needs

### Key Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Permission During Coffee Break
Alex starts a large refactoring task with Claude and steps away for coffee. Claude needs permission to modify a configuration file. Alex receives a notification on their phone, reviews the change, and approves it without returning to their desk. Claude continues working uninterrupted.

#### Scenario 2: Overnight Build Monitoring
Priya kicks off a complex build process with Claude before leaving the office. The background service monitors the operation overnight. When the build completes at 2 AM, the service detects completion and sends a success notification. Priya sees the result first thing in the morning.

#### Scenario 3: Battery-Conscious Monitoring
Carlos is working remotely with 20% battery remaining. The background service automatically reduces polling frequency to conserve power while still maintaining essential monitoring. Critical notifications are still delivered immediately.

#### Scenario 4: Multi-Project Management
Dana manages three active Claude sessions across different projects. The background service tracks all three, showing a persistent notification with the overall status. When one project encounters an error, Dana receives a specific alert for that project.

### Success Criteria

From the user's perspective, Background Services succeed when:

1. **Notification Delivery**: 100% of permission requests generate notifications within 3 seconds
2. **Battery Efficiency**: Less than 3% battery drain per hour of monitoring
3. **Reliability**: Service recovers automatically from all non-fatal errors
4. **Performance**: No noticeable impact on device performance
5. **Persistence**: Service survives app updates, device restarts, and memory pressure

## Technical Context

### Android Platform Constraints

1. **Foreground Service Requirements**: Must show persistent notification
2. **Background Execution Limits**: Restricted background activity on Android 8.0+
3. **Doze Mode**: Deep sleep state that suspends network access
4. **App Standby Buckets**: Frequency limits based on app usage
5. **Battery Optimization**: System may kill background services

### Integration Points

1. **WebSocket Communication**: Monitor active connections
2. **Notification System**: Rich notifications with actions
3. **WorkManager**: Scheduled background tasks
4. **PowerManager**: Battery state monitoring
5. **ConnectivityManager**: Network state changes

### Dependencies

- Android Foreground Service API
- NotificationCompat for backwards compatibility
- WorkManager for guaranteed task execution
- Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- Hilt for dependency injection

## Expected Outcomes

### For Users

1. **Uninterrupted Workflow**: Claude continues working with minimal intervention
2. **Peace of Mind**: Confidence that nothing important is missed
3. **Battery Life**: Efficient monitoring that respects device resources
4. **Timely Information**: Immediate awareness of important events

### For Development Teams

1. **Faster Iteration**: Reduced wait times for Claude operations
2. **Better Debugging**: Detailed logs of background operations
3. **Resource Optimization**: Proactive server resource management
4. **Improved Reliability**: Automatic recovery from common issues

### For the Organization

1. **Competitive Advantage**: Superior background capabilities vs competitors
2. **User Retention**: Reliable notifications keep users engaged
3. **Reduced Support**: Automatic recovery reduces support tickets
4. **Platform Excellence**: Best-in-class Android implementation

## Scope Definition

### In Scope

- Foreground service for persistent monitoring
- Notification system with channels and actions
- Battery-aware polling frequency adjustment
- Connection health monitoring
- Session state persistence
- WorkManager scheduled tasks
- Permission request notifications
- Task completion notifications
- Error and status notifications
- Wake lock management for critical operations

### Out of Scope

- Background location tracking
- Audio/video streaming in background
- File synchronization services
- Push notification server infrastructure
- iOS background service implementation
- Real-time collaboration features
- Background code execution

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Battery Drain Complaints
**Risk**: Users disable the app due to perceived battery drain
**Mitigation**: Adaptive polling, clear battery usage display, user education

### Risk 2: Notification Fatigue
**Risk**: Too many notifications cause users to disable them
**Mitigation**: Smart grouping, importance levels, user preferences

### Risk 3: Service Killed by System
**Risk**: Android kills the service to reclaim resources
**Mitigation**: Proper foreground service implementation, WorkManager backup

### Risk 4: Doze Mode Interference  
**Risk**: Doze mode prevents timely notification delivery
**Mitigation**: High-priority FCM messages, battery optimization exemption request

## Success Metrics

1. **Service Uptime**: >99.5% while monitoring active
2. **Notification Latency**: <3 seconds from event to notification
3. **Battery Impact**: <3% per hour during active monitoring
4. **Crash Rate**: <0.1% of background service sessions
5. **User Engagement**: >80% of users enable background monitoring
6. **Permission Response Time**: 50% reduction vs. no notifications
7. **Task Completion Awareness**: 90% of completions seen within 5 minutes

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Android Version Differences

- **Android 8.0+**: Notification channels required
- **Android 9.0+**: Foreground service permission needed
- **Android 10.0+**: Background location restrictions
- **Android 11.0+**: Package visibility restrictions
- **Android 12.0+**: Exact alarm restrictions
- **Android 13.0+**: Runtime notification permission

### Device Manufacturer Variations

- **Samsung**: Aggressive battery optimization
- **Xiaomi/MIUI**: Additional permission requirements
- **Huawei/EMUI**: Background activity restrictions
- **OnePlus**: Custom Doze implementation

The Background Services feature must handle these variations gracefully while providing consistent functionality across all supported devices.
