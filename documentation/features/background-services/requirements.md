# Background Services - Requirements

## User Stories

### Story 1: Enable Background Monitoring
**As a** developer using Pocket Agent

- 1.5: WHEN all projects are disconnected THEN the system SHALL stop the background service completely

### Story 2: Receive Permission Notifications
**As a** developer with active Claude sessions  
**I want to** receive immediate notifications when Claude needs permission  
**So that** I can approve or deny requests without opening the app  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- 2.6: WHEN a permission times out THEN the system SHALL dismiss the notification and apply default policy

### Story 3: Monitor Multiple Projects
**As a** developer working on multiple projects  
**I want to** monitor several Claude sessions simultaneously  
**So that** I can manage multiple workflows efficiently

- 3.5: WHEN viewing the persistent notification THEN the system SHALL display overall connection status

### Story 4: Preserve Battery Life
**As a** mobile user concerned about battery  
**I want** the background service to adapt to my battery level  
**So that** monitoring doesn't excessively drain my battery  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 4.1: WHEN battery is below 30% THEN the system SHALL decrease polling frequency automatically
- 4.2: WHEN battery is below 15% THEN the system SHALL show only critical notifications

- 4.5: WHEN in Doze mode THEN the system SHALL batch non-critical operations

### Story 5: Handle Task Completion
**As a** developer running long tasks with Claude  
**I want to** be notified when tasks complete  
**So that** I know when to review results or take next actions  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 5.1: WHEN Claude completes a task THEN the system SHALL send a notification
- 5.2: WHEN viewing the completion notification THEN the system SHALL indicate success or failure
- 5.3: WHEN the task modified files THEN the system SHALL show the count in the notification
- 5.4: WHEN I tap the notification THEN the system SHALL open the app to that project's chat
- 5.5: WHEN multiple tasks complete THEN the system SHALL group notifications by project

### Story 6: Manage Background Permissions
**As a** user concerned about privacy and resources  
**I want to** control background service permissions and behavior  
**So that** I have full control over what runs on my device  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 6.1: WHEN I first enable monitoring THEN the system SHALL explain why permissions are needed
- 6.2: WHEN Android requests battery optimization exemption THEN the system SHALL show clear explanation
- 6.3: WHEN I want to stop all monitoring THEN the system SHALL disable everything with a single action

- 6.5: WHEN I deny permissions THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality

### Story 7: Recover from Interruptions
**As a** developer with unreliable conditions  
**I want** the service to recover from interruptions automatically  
**So that** temporary issues don't disrupt my workflow  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 7.1: WHEN the app is force-stopped THEN the system SHALL restart the service when I open the app
- 7.2: WHEN the device restarts THEN the system SHALL resume active monitoring automatically
- 7.3: WHEN the service crashes THEN the system SHALL restart and restore previous state
- 7.4: WHEN memory is low THEN the system SHALL preserve critical state before termination
- 7.5: WHEN the app updates THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring without manual intervention

### Story 8: Schedule Maintenance Tasks
**As a** user wanting optimal app performance  
**I want** the app to perform maintenance automatically  
**So that** it stays fast and doesn't consume excessive storage  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 8.1: WHEN old messages accumulate THEN the system SHALL clean them up automatically
- 8.2: WHEN cache grows large THEN the system SHALL remove old cached data
- 8.3: WHEN cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL execute it during charging or idle time
- 8.4: WHEN maintenance completes THEN the system SHALL show no user notification
- 8.5: WHEN storage is critically low THEN the system SHALL run emergency cleanup immediately
