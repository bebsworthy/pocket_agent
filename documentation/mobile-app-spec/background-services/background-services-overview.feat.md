# Background Services Feature Specification - Overview
**For Android Mobile Application**

> **Navigation**: [Index](./background-services-index.md) | **Overview** | [Foreground Service](./background-services-foreground.feat.md) | [Notifications](./background-services-notifications.feat.md) | [Monitoring](./background-services-monitoring.feat.md) | [Testing](./background-services-testing.feat.md)

## Overview

The Background Services feature provides the persistent monitoring and notification infrastructure for **Pocket Agent - a remote coding agent mobile interface**. This feature implements Android's foreground service for continuous connection monitoring, WorkManager for scheduled tasks, a comprehensive notification system, and battery-aware optimization strategies. It ensures that Claude Code sessions remain active and users receive timely updates even when the app is not in the foreground.

**Target Platform**: Native Android Application (API 26+)
**Development Environment**: Android Studio with Kotlin
**Architecture**: Service-based architecture with WorkManager and Foreground Service
**Primary Specification**: [Frontend Technical Specification](../frontend.spec.md#background-monitoring-service)

This feature is designed to be implemented in Phase 2 as critical infrastructure that supports all other features. It provides the foundation for real-time notifications, connection persistence, and background task execution while respecting Android's battery optimization requirements.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack (Android-Specific)

- **Foreground Service**: Android Foreground Service - Persistent execution with notification
- **Task Scheduling**: WorkManager 2.9.0+ - Guaranteed background task execution
- **Notifications**: NotificationCompat - Rich notifications with actions
- **Process Lifecycle**: ProcessLifecycleOwner - App lifecycle monitoring
- **Power Management**: PowerManager & BatteryManager - Battery-aware optimizations
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt with ServiceComponent - Service-scoped dependencies
- **Coroutines**: Kotlin Coroutines with Service scope - Async operations
- **Mobile Optimization**: Doze mode compliance, battery optimization exemptions

### Key Components

- **BackgroundOperationsService**: Main foreground service managing all background operations
- **AppNotificationManager**: Centralized notification creation and management
- **ConnectionHealthMonitor**: Periodic health checks for active connections with health criteria
- **BatteryOptimizationManager**: Adjusts polling frequencies based on battery state
- **SessionStatePersistence**: Persists and restores session state across app lifecycle
- **BackgroundTaskScheduler**: Scheduled tasks for cleanup and maintenance via WorkManager
- **DefaultPermissionPolicyManager**: Automated permission handling with predefined policies
- **WakeLockManager**: Manages wake locks for critical operations
- **ServerResourceMonitor**: Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage on remote server
- **ProgressParser**: Detects operation completion status from Claude messages
- **BackgroundVoiceManager**: Text-to-speech announcements for background events

   - Notification testing

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **Foreground Service Requirements**
   - Must show persistent notification within 5 seconds of starting
   - Requires `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permission
   - Must handle `startForegroundService()` vs `startService()` based on Android version
   - Notification channel must be created before posting notification

2. **Battery Optimization**
   - Request battery optimization exemption for critical operations
   - Implement adaptive polling based on battery level
   - Use JobScheduler/WorkManager for deferrable tasks
   - Minimize wake lock usage

3. **Process Death Handling**
   - Service must be able to restart and restore state
   - Use persistent storage for critical session information
   - Implement START_STICKY or START_REDELIVER_INTENT appropriately

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Services have higher memory priority but should still minimize usage
- **CPU Usage**: Implement efficient polling with exponential backoff
- **Battery Impact**: Use battery-aware scheduling and minimize background work
- **Network Efficiency**: Batch network requests when possible
