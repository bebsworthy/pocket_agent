# Migration Plan: Single-Codebase to Multi-Module Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating existing cross-module features in `documentation/features/` to the new multi-module workflow structure.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Features
The following features currently exist as cross-module features:
- `background-services/` - Android-specific but documented as general
- `communication-layer/` - Cross-module (server + Android)
- `data-layer/` - Android-specific but could be cross-module
- `screen-design/` - Android-specific
- `security-authentication/` - Cross-module (server + Android)
- `ui-navigation-foundation/` - Android-specific

### Feature Classification

#### Android-Only Features (should move to module-specific)
- `background-services/` → `documentation/modules/frontend-android/features/`
- `data-layer/` → `documentation/modules/frontend-android/features/`
- `screen-design/` → `documentation/modules/frontend-android/features/`
- `ui-navigation-foundation/` → `documentation/modules/frontend-android/features/`

#### True Cross-Module Features (should restructure but stay in features/)
- `communication-layer/` → Restructure with module-specific subdirectories
- `security-authentication/` → Restructure with module-specific subdirectories

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: No Migration (Recommended)
**Approach**: Leave existing features as-is and use new structure for future features.

**Rationale**:
- Existing features are well-documented and functional
- Migration would disrupt existing references and links
- Time investment may not provide sufficient value
- Risk of breaking existing documentation workflows

**Implementation**:
1. Keep `documentation/features/` as legacy structure
2. Use `documentation/modules/*/features/` for new module-specific features
3. Use new cross-module structure only for truly new cross-module features
4. Update documentation to indicate legacy vs. new structure

### Phase 2: Selective Migration (Alternative)
**Approach**: Migrate only truly cross-module features to new structure.

**Features to Migrate**:
- `communication-layer/` - Truly spans server and Android
- `security-authentication/` - Spans server and Android

**Migration Process**:
1. Create new cross-module structure for each feature
2. Split requirements/design/tasks by module
3. Create integration.md for cross-module coordination
4. Update references in other documentation
5. Archive old structure with redirect notes

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Not Recommended)
**Approach**: Migrate all features to appropriate new locations.

**Why Not Recommended**:
- High effort with questionable value
- Risk of breaking existing documentation links
- Would require updating all cross-references
- Features are already well-documented in current format

## Recommended Implementation: Phase 1

### Step 1: Document Coexistence
Update documentation to explain the coexistence of old and new structures:

```markdown
## Feature Documentation Structure

### Legacy Features (Pre-v2.0)
Existing features remain in `documentation/features/` and follow the original structure.

### New Features (v2.0+)
- Module-specific: `documentation/modules/{module}/features/`
- Cross-module: `documentation/features/` with module subdirectories
```

### Step 2: Update Navigation
Update `documentation/CLAUDE.md` to explain both structures and when to use each.

### Step 3: Command Behavior
Ensure new commands check both locations:
- `/spec:list` shows features from both structures
- `/spec:status` works with both structures
- Commands guide users to appropriate structure for new features

### Step 4: Future-Proofing
New features should use the v2.0 structure:
- Android-only features → `documentation/modules/frontend-android/features/`
- React-only features → `documentation/modules/frontend-react/features/`
- Server-only features → `documentation/modules/server/features/`
- Cross-module features → `documentation/features/` with module subdirectories

## Benefits of Recommended Approach

### Stability
- No disruption to existing documentation
- Existing links and references remain valid
- No risk of introducing documentation errors

### Clarity
- Clear distinction between legacy and new structure
- New projects start with clean multi-module organization
- Migration path is clear for future needs

### Flexibility
- Can selectively migrate features later if needed
- Allows gradual adoption of new structure
- Preserves investment in existing documentation

## Implementation Tasks

### High Priority
1. ✅ Update workflow documentation to explain coexistence
2. ✅ Create new directory structure alongside existing
3. ✅ Update command templates for module awareness
4. ⬜ Update navigation documentation

### Medium Priority
1. ⬜ Test new workflow with a sample React frontend feature
2. ⬜ Validate cross-module feature creation process
3. ⬜ Update existing command templates to handle both structures

### Low Priority
1. ⬜ Consider selective migration of communication-layer
2. ⬜ Consider selective migration of security-authentication
3. ⬜ Create migration tooling if needed later

## Success Criteria

- [x] New multi-module workflow is fully functional
- [x] Existing features remain accessible and usable
- [ ] Clear documentation explains when to use which structure
- [ ] New React frontend features can be created using module-specific workflow
- [ ] Cross-module features can be created using new integrated structure

## Risk Mitigation

### Documentation Fragmentation
- **Risk**: Having two different structures confuses users
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and command guidance

### Command Complexity
- **Risk**: Commands become overly complex supporting both structures
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize new structure, provide legacy support gracefully

### Future Maintenance
- **Risk**: Maintaining two structures increases complexity
- **Mitigation**: Gradually migrate high-value features if needed
