## Summary
The WebSocket service implementation demonstrates excellent architecture with comprehensive reconnection logic, type-safe message handling, and proper React integration. The implementation follows modern TypeScript patterns and provides robust error handling. However, there are several critical issues and improvements that need to be addressed before approval.

## Critical Issues ðŸ”´

### TypeScript & Type Safety

- [x] **COMPLETED** EventEmitter Type Declaration Mismatch
  - **File**: `WebSocketService.ts:55-64`

## Important Improvements ðŸŸ¡

### React Patterns & Performance

- [x] **COMPLETED** Hook Dependency Array Inconsistency
  - **File**: `hooks.ts:31-72`

  - **Solution**: Used proper memoization techniques to stabilize dependencies and prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - **Result**: Optimized hook performance and eliminated dependency array issues

- [x] **COMPLETED** Context Value Stability
  - **File**: `WebSocketContext.tsx:254-259`
  - **Fixed**: Memoized context value and made all context functions stable with useCallback
  - **Solution**: Used useMemo for context value and useCallback for all context methods
  - **Result**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of all context consumers

- [x] **COMPLETED** Hook Ref Pattern Issue
  - **File**: `useWebSocket.ts:57-84`
  - **Fixed**: Replaced manual serviceRef management with proper context-based service access
  - **Solution**: Refactored to use WebSocketContext for service management instead of manual refs
  - **Result**: Eliminated stale reference issues and simplified service lifecycle management

### State Management Architecture

- [x] **COMPLETED** Atom Structure Complexity
  - **File**: `websocket.ts:15-191`
  - **Fixed**: Created consolidated WebSocketServerState interface and single source of truth
  - **Solution**: Combined related server state into single atom with derived atoms for backward compatibility
  - **Result**: Simplified state updates, better consistency, and reduced complexity

- [x] **COMPLETED** Derived Atom Performance
  - **File**: `websocket.ts:203-237`
  - **Fixed**: Optimized derived atoms to use direct iteration with early exit patterns
  - **Solution**: Rewrote derived atoms to work directly with consolidated state and use efficient iteration
  - **Result**: Better performance for frequent reads with early exit optimizations

### Error Handling

- [x] **COMPLETED** Error Boundary Integration
  - **File**: `WebSocketErrorBoundary.tsx` (new file) + `WebSocketContext.tsx:140-147`
  - **Fixed**: Created comprehensive error boundary system with React integration
  - **Solution**: Built WebSocketErrorBoundary component with error handler hook and integrated with context
  - **Result**: Unhandled WebSocket errors are caught and handled gracefully without crashing component trees

- [x] **COMPLETED** localStorage Error Handling
  - **File**: `WebSocketService.ts:464-623`
  - **Fixed**: Implemented comprehensive fallback strategies and robust error handling
  - **Solution**: Added localStorage availability checks, quota management, data validation, and cleanup strategies
  - **Result**: Handles all localStorage failure scenarios including private browsing, quota exceeded, and corrupted data

## Suggestions ðŸŸ¢

### Mobile Optimization

- [x] **COMPLETED** Connection Debouncing
  - **File**: `WebSocketService.ts:105-123`
  - **Fixed**: Added connection debouncing with 1-second minimum delay between attempts
  - **Solution**: Implemented debounce logic with timeout management to prevent rapid connection cycles
  - **Result**: Prevents connection storms on mobile networks and improves stability

- [ ] Visibility API Integration
  - **File**: `WebSocketContext.tsx`
  - **Suggested**: Pause reconnection attempts when page is hidden
  - **Reason**: Battery optimization for mobile devices

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Message Queue Optimization
  - **File**: `websocket.ts:157-169`
  - **Current**: Array slice for message limiting
  - **Suggested**: Use circular buffer implementation
  - **Reason**: Better performance for high-message-rate scenarios

- [ ] Connection Pooling Documentation
  - **File**: `WebSocketService.ts`
  - **Suggested**: Add JSDoc explaining single connection per server pattern
  - **Reason**: Clarify architectural decision for maintainers

## Detailed Findings

### TypeScript & Type Safety

The WebSocket service implementation shows good TypeScript usage overall but has several type safety issues that need addressing:

1. **EventEmitter Generic Types**: The custom event interface declaration doesn't properly extend EventEmitter with generic types, creating type inconsistencies.

2. **Type Assertions**: Using `as any` defeats the purpose of TypeScript's type system and should be avoided.

3. **Missing Return Types**: Several methods lack explicit return type annotations, which is required for strict TypeScript compliance.

### React Patterns & Performance

The React integration is well-architected but has room for optimization:

1. **Context Optimization**: The WebSocket context value is recreated on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders of consumer components.

2. **Hook Dependencies**: The custom hooks have complex dependency patterns that could be simplified and made more predictable.

3. **Event Listener Management**: While functional, the event listener setup could be more robust with proper cleanup guarantees.

### Mobile Optimization

The implementation includes mobile considerations but could be enhanced:

1. **Network State Awareness**: No integration with network connection APIs for mobile optimization.

2. **Background/Foreground Handling**: Missing integration with Page Visibility API for better mobile battery management.

3. **Connection Debouncing**: Mobile networks can cause rapid state changes that aren't handled optimally.

### WebSocket Implementation

The core WebSocket implementation is solid but has some protocol concerns:

1. **Ping/Pong Strategy**: The custom ping implementation may not align with server expectations.

2. **Connection State Validation**: Some race conditions possible in connection timeout handling.

3. **Protocol Compliance**: Good alignment with server protocol, but custom extensions need validation.

### State Integration

The Jotai integration is comprehensive but complex:

1. **Atom Granularity**: Many small atoms create complexity in updates and consistency.

2. **Derived Atom Performance**: Some derived atoms could be optimized for better performance.

3. **State Synchronization**: Multiple sources of truth could lead to inconsistencies.

## Action Items for Developer

1. **Fix EventEmitter typing issues** - Replace type assertions with proper generic types
2. **Implement proper cleanup patterns** - Add AbortController or explicit cleanup tracking
3. **Optimize Context and Hook patterns** - Memoize context values and stabilize hook dependencies
4. **Add comprehensive error boundaries** - Integrate with React Error Boundary pattern
5. **Validate ping/pong implementation** - Ensure server protocol compatibility
6. **Implement mobile optimizations** - Add Page Visibility API and network state awareness
7. **Add missing return type annotations** - Ensure full TypeScript strict mode compliance
8. **Consider atom architecture simplification** - Evaluate if current granularity is optimal
